# Machine-Learning
Few machine learning algorithm examples

In here you'll find various machine learning exercises found around the internet. I do not own them.

# Gradient Descent
In this example, we have a training set containing sales and spendings with media.

The model is then trained with a training set containing 200 observations, each labeled as $(Spendings_i , Sales_i)$
